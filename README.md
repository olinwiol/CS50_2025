# CS50_2025
My solutions to the problem sets and the project for CS50 2025.

## Problem Set 0 - Starting from Scratch
Choosing my own adventure where the assignment is to 
implement a project of my own choosing in Scratch.

I've chosen the project I've named "Save the Dino Babys" where
as the main character 'Petra' you need to save all the Dino Babys
who are falling from the sky.

Using different codeblocks with, `loops`, `if` and `while`-statements I could both
complete the project and save the babies.
